## Contributors

Some guidelines for contribution

1. Read the documentation: Before contributing, make sure to read the project's documentation thoroughly. This will help you understand the project's goals, how it works, and any guidelines for contributing.

2. Fork the repository: If you want to contribute to a project, the first step is to fork the project's repository on GitHub. This creates a copy of the project that you can work on without affecting the original.

3. Create a new branch: Create a new branch in your forked repository to work on your changes. This helps keep your changes separate from the main development branch.

4. Make changes and commit: Make your changes to the code or documentation and commit them to your branch. Try to keep your commits small and focused on a specific change or feature.

5. Write tests: If you are adding new features or making significant changes, make sure to write tests to ensure that your changes are working as expected and do not introduce new bugs.

6. Submit a pull request: When you are ready to contribute your changes back to the original repository, submit a pull request. This notifies the project maintainers of your changes and allows them to review and merge your changes if they are accepted.

7. Be open to feedback: When submitting a pull request, be open to feedback from the project maintainers and other contributors. They may suggest changes or improvements to your code or documentation to ensure that it meets the project's standards.

8. Follow the code of conduct: Finally, make sure to follow the project's code of conduct and be respectful and professional when communicating with other contributors. Open-source projects are a collaborative effort, and it's important to maintain a positive and inclusive community.
